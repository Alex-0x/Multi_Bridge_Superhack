# Multi_Bridge_Superhack

Welcome to the Multi_Bridge_Superhack repository, this project has been specifically created for Ethglobal's Superhack and utilizes Chainlink's CCIP protocol for linking between Ethereum's layer 1 and layer 2. In this initial phase, the linking is limited to the testnet environment.

The project structure is organized into two main folders:

1. `multi_bridge_fe` (Front-End): This folder contains the code for the front-end part of the application. However, this folder is located in a separate repository. You can find this part of the code at the following address: [https://github.com/Alex-0x/Multi_Bridge_Superhack_FrontEnd](https://github.com/Alex-0x/Multi_Bridge_Superhack_FrontEnd).

2. `MultiBridge_sk` (Smart Contracts): This folder will house the files related to the smart contracts of the project.
